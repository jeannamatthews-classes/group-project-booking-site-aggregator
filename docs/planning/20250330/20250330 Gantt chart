Gantt chart Updates:
There were three basic tasks for this week: Development, UI/UX, and ASMP services. Development specifically was building the initial setup of code in a vscode environment. This included a basic
database setup, unit tests, and testing the unit tests. This went smoothly as it was a very high level directive of planning for the future. The UI/UX wasn't implemented this week however. There was
a few revisions of it but the first draft was implemented and it was a basic angular server. Looking back we did not end up using this UI/UX but it did provide a good idea of what a final version could be.
The ASMP services are an abreviation of Authentication, Management, Staff, and Payment. Management and Staff were the first to be implemented.

Risks:
Payment has proven to be the most difficult to deal with because it requires using the stripe api which we need a login for so that task has been pushed to be done later in the project. This could
be an issue if it is more time consuming than we think. Otherwise the project is in early development and we are in a good position.
