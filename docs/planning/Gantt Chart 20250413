Gantt Update:
This week was a ligth work week for coding. The team started to test the front end and backend using unit tests and angular files. Everything went smoothly because there wasn't much to do.
This was the friday of RAPs so mos tof our focus was on making a presentation to display. That being said we had a functional demo that was prety much a final product. 

Risks:
Still no payment integration and the UI is very basic. The next steps will likely be to update the UI and then try and deal witth the payument system. However, we have completed the requiremnts that we told our user we
would have by the end of the semester so anything past this point will be extra.
