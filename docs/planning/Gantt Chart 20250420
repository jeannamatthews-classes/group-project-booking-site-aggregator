Gantt chart Update:
more testing was done this week for both backend and frontend. However, there were changes in the gantt chart. These changes were good though because originally we scheduled the staff table and
reward tracking to be done this week and they were done before now. Both of those things were implemented by the time of RAPs. We are newaring the final deployment of the project and all is going
smoothyl with regards to the code. 

Risks:
Taking too much time for RAPs and maybe overlooking some important details might create some issues although this is unlikely to happen it is a risk
