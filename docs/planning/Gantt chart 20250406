Gantt Chart Update:
The UI/UX has functionality although it is basic. The main focus this week was on the database integrations along with the Authentication services and attendence for staff. This was implemented
successfully. Although, with the project being in a demo state we do not plan to use the authentication until the project is complete. The databases are showing up in the UI and they are able to be
changed in the website that we have deployed. The majority of work done this week was on databases and getting the postgres database setup for future adaptations.

Risks:
Right now the UI is crude but that isn't too big of a concern because that can be a relatively last minute change for some finishing touches so that the MVP is in good standing.
