Gantt chart Update:
This week was spent finalizing all of our existing code and testing everything as one project. No new additional code added and no new functionality. The only changes were an updated UI that has a more refined 
and the final product looks. We began the deployment of our product to test it for actual user scenarios. The version of the project that is in GitHub as of right now is likely the finished product. 
Overall, no changes to the Gantt chart this week except for an addition of a new UI task.

Risks:
As of now there aren't really and risks because the project is at the final revisions and likely nothing else to add save for a payment integration which will likely be added as a continuation of this project
if the user wants us to continue development
