ANGULAR TUTORIAL
1. cd to angular project (terminal should say angular_18_tutorial)
2. ng serve
3. If ng serve doesn't work, make sure Angular CLI is installed globally (npm install -g @angular/cli)
4. If the server still doesn't start, there might be an issue with dependencies. Fix it by resetting them:: rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
5. then npm install (this will reinstall packages and dependencies)
6. ng serve and follow the localhost link
