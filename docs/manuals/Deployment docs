ANGULAR TUTORIAL
1. cd to angular project (terminal should say angular_18_tutorial)
2. ng serve
3. if that doesn't work make sure that angular is installed
4. if the server still won't start: rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
5. then npm install (this will reinstall packages and dependencies)
6. ng serve and follow the localhost link
