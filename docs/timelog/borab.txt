Task Description:

I was working on the backend development, focusing on database design and API integration. 
My tasks involved understanding the system architecture, particularly the microservices approach 
for managing staff, authentication, and rewards. I also explored how different backend components interact, 
including user authentication, shift management, and payment gateway integration using Stripe API

Task Description:  
Worked on UI/UX design focusing specifically on the user authentication page using Angular. 
This task involved implementing the layout and design elements necessary for the login page, 
ensuring a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface. Continued development of the underlying code for handling user authentication processes.

Time Spent: Approximately  30 hours  
Task Description:  
I have contributed to enhancing the UI/UX design by refining the user authentication page. This includes optimizing the login workflow and integrating advanced security features to ensure robust user authentication. The improvements made can be seamlessly integrated into Ankit's ongoing project to enhance overall user experience and security.

I estimate that these tasks took additional time to ensure thorough testing and integration, bringing the total time invested in this aspect of the project to approximately 30 hours. This includes both design and coding, along with collaboration with other team members to align this enhancement with the broader project objectives.

Task Discription:
I contributed to the development of a fully functional reference frontend design that is fully integrated with a FastAPI backend. This implementation replicates the core structure and functionality of the original Booking Site Aggregator project being developed by the team, but with significant improvements in design and user experience. The interface has been polished with clean CSS, a cohesive dashboard layout, and a modular structure that enhances usability and clarity throughout the application
This version includes all major functional components such as user authentication (login and signup), staff and guest management with full CRUD capabilities, booking and inventory control, a point-of-sale system, guest add-on features, smart lock simulations, a unified inbox for communication, and an automated messaging system. Although real-time API integrations with platforms like Guesty, Hospitable, and Capshot are currently represented by mock endpoints, the backend has been structured to support seamless integration with these services in future deployments.

All data within the application is currently simulated or used as placeholders, but the entire system is fully operational for demonstration purposes. The project has been developed as a complete and scalable reference model, designed not only for presentation but also as a production-ready version of the original concept.While my primary responsibility in this project was focused on frontend design, I ensured my contribution extended beyond styling by aligning the UI with backend functionalities and presentation goals. This work serves as a solid, practical reference for the ongoing project and reflects my dedication to contributing meaningfully to the broader development effort.
