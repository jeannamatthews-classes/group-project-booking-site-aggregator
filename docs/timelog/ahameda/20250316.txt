Task Description:
I structured the required layout for the assignment, "Additions to GitHub Repos and Time Tracking Materials." This involved:

Creating the docs directory.
Adding the planning and timelog subdirectories.
Setting up a 20250303 subdirectory under planning and uploading the necessary files.
Organizing the timelog section by adding my own subdirectory and informing the team members to add theirs.

P.S. The 20250303 subdirectory contains a total of four files, each serving a specific purpose:

1: Booking Site GANTT Chart - Initial Scheduler.pdf → A PDF version of the Gantt chart.
2: GANTT Chart and Identification of Key Risks.txt → A text file addressing key project questions.
3: Initial_Brainstorming.png → A screenshot of our group’s brainstorming session.
4: Mind Map.pdf → A PDF representation of our project's conceptual framework.
